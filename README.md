### Description :

The provided code is a Python application for cracking SMTP credentials using a graphical user interface (GUI). The application is designed to test a list of email and password combinations (referred to as "Mail Access combos") against various SMTP servers to identify valid credentials. The GUI is built using the `tkinter` library, and the application leverages multithreading to perform the cracking process efficiently.

### Usage : 

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed.
   - Install the required `requests` library using `pip install requests`.

2. **Run the Application:**
   - Execute the script using `python smtp.py`.
   - Use the GUI to select a combo file, specify the number of threads, and start the cracking process.

3. **Monitor Results:**
   - The GUI will display the count of valid and invalid credentials.
   - Valid credentials will be saved to `cracked_smtps.txt` and `cracked_Mailaccess.txt`.

### Note

This application is intended for educational and ethical purposes only. Unauthorized use of this tool to access or crack SMTP servers without permission is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have proper authorization before using such tools.
